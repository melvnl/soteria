# Overview

Inspired from Netflix series "How to Sell Drugs Online Fast" scene where Moritz threaten a drug dealer with this app that he claim "will notify/alert all his facebook contact" with a single button click. I create Soteria inspired from that scene. Soteria will automatically send an alert message that contains your whereabout (latitude, longitude, and address from reverse geocode).

# How It Works

- Make sure you active your location/gps
- Allow app to access your device location/gps
- Save your desired whatsapp number(your mom, police, etc) in contact screen
- Tap Alert button to send the alert message

# NOTE

The app WON'T send a message directly to whatsapp number, instead it will your whatsapp application with prefilled text field, you need to manually tap the send button. WhatsApp won't allow direct message being sent due to privacy and security policies.
